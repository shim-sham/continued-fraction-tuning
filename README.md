# tuning systems! (in progress...)
This project compares the different types of tuning systems: pythagorean, just intonation, and equal temperament.<br>
It creates the fractions needed for each interval for each system from scratch to show exactly how each system works.
<br>N.B.: The Hackatime tracking for this didn't count the first 1 hour and 41 mins I spent on this, as I hadn't initialised this repo yet!
## why I made this
This is inspired by <a href = "https://www.whitman.edu/Documents/Academics/Mathematics/bartha.pdf" target="_blank">Piano Tuning and Continued Fractions</a> by Matthew Barta, an article I found while researching the real world applications of continued fractions.

## how I made this
A *lot* of research on the systems of tuning was put into this to find out exactly how each one works. <br>
I tried getting the maths parts done first, and *then* i added css and outputting to screen.
## what I struggled with and what I learned
- learnt that pythagorean tuning starts descending in perfect fifths from minor second onwards, to create a more accurate system.
- learnt about Math.pow
