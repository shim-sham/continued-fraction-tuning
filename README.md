# tuning systems!
This project compares the different types of tuning systems: pythagorean, just intonation, and equal temperament.<br>
It creates the fractions needed for each interval for each system from scratch to show exactly how each system works.
<br>N.B.: The Hackatime tracking for this didn't count the first 1 hour and 41 mins I spent on this, as I hadn't initialised this repo yet!

## why I made this
This is inspired by <a href = "https://www.whitman.edu/Documents/Academics/Mathematics/bartha.pdf" target="_blank">Piano Tuning and Continued Fractions</a> by Matthew Barta, an article I found while researching the real world applications of continued fractions. Plus, I'm passionate about both maths and music so i thought this would be a great way to merge the two!

## how I made this
A *lot* of research on the systems of tuning was put into this to find out exactly how each one works. <br>
I tried getting the maths parts done first (including outputting last frequency played; it worked well as a check that everything's going fine!), in order of which they appear on the website, and *then* i added css. at first it was just one page with a lot of info, so i split it into multiple pages to make it more narrative.
## what I struggled with and what I learned
- learnt that Pythagorean tuning starts descending in perfect fifths from minor second onwards, to create a more accurate/harmonious system.
- learnt about Math.pow
- learnt about indexOf()
- learnt about Just Intonation and Equal temperament
- learnt about using querySelectorAll() for elements that appear multiple times.
- improved on my confidence with using Tone.js
- struggled with scrolls in CSS
- struggles with getting the positioning right in CSS
